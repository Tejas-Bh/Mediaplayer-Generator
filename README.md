# Mediaplayer-Generator

mediaplayer-generator is a tool made for concert playback systems. It turns a directory of audio and video files into an interactive web-based playlist app in which you can simply select which files to play.

To use it, make sure you have:
```
natsort
glob
tkinter #(should come by default)
```

Then, simply run the python program.

Select a directory which you want to turn into a mediaplayer, add your notes, and the program will do its magic.
